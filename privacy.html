                    <strong>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.</strong> By using
                    Tome, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

                    Library) to retrieve book information and cover images. These searches
                    are anonymous and not associated with your identity.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

                <h3>Local Storage</h3>
                <p>
                    All your library data is stored locally on your device using iOS
                    and macOS's secure storage mechanisms. Your data remains on your
                    device and is under your control.
                </p>

                <h3>iCloud Storage</h3>
                <p>
                    If you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your personal iCloud
                    account. iCloud data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Your
                    data is protected by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apple's end-to-end encryption for iCloud data</li>
                    <li>Your Apple ID authentication and security settings</li>
                    <li>Apple's security infrastructure and practices</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>We do not have access to your iCloud data.</strong> Your data
                    is stored in your personal iCloud account, and we cannot view, access,
                    or retrieve it.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Security</h3>
                <p>
                    We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures
                    to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the
                    internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
                    commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee
                    its absolute security.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    Your data is retained on your device for as long as you have the app
                    installed. You can delete your data at any time by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deleting individual books from your library</li>
                    <li>Deleting the entire library data through the app's settings</li>
                    <li>Uninstalling the app and deleting its data from your device</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you delete your data from your device, it will also be removed from
                    iCloud (if sync is enabled) across all your devices.
                </p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>

                    13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your
                    child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and
                    we will delete such information.

                <h3>Open Library API</h3>

                    Tome uses the Open Library API to search for and retrieve book

                    and cover images. Open Library's privacy policy is available at

                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated
                    version will be indicated by a revised "Last Updated" date, and the
                    new policy will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage
                    you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
                </p>

                <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>
                    Your data is stored on your device and, if you enable iCloud sync,
                    in Apple's iCloud data centers. Apple may transfer your data to
                    countries other than your own as described in their
                    <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" style="color: #667eea;">Privacy Policy</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>California Residents</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are a resident of California, you may have specific rights
                    regarding your personal information under the California Consumer Privacy
                    Act (CCPA). However, since Tome does not sell personal information
                    and only uses your data locally on your device (with optional iCloud
                    sync), most CCPA rights are naturally satisfied by the app's design.
                </p>
